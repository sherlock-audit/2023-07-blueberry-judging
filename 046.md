# Failed transaction when trying to distribute rewards in the `AuraSpell.sol` contract
## Summary
The `openPositionFarm` function in the provided contract includes a rewards distribution loop that iterates over an array of reward tokens and calls a distribution function for each token. However, this loop could potentially lead to gas exhaustion and out-of-gas conditions, opening the door for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `openPositionFarm` function aims to open a position in the Aura protocol, borrow funds, add liquidity to a Balancer pool, and distribute rewards to users. One step involves iterating over an array of reward tokens and distributing rewards using the `_doRefundRewards` function. The loop's structure is as follows:
```solidity
for (uint256 i; i != rewardTokensLength; ) {
    _doRefundRewards(rewardTokens[i] == STASH_AURA ? AURA : rewardTokens[i]);
    unchecked { ++i; }
}
```
While seemingly straightforward, this loop presents a potential gas exhaustion issue. If the `rewardTokens` array contains a substantial number of tokens or if the reward distribution logic itself is complex and gas-intensive, executing this loop within the `openPositionFarm` function could consume an excessive amount of gas. This could result in the transaction running out of gas before completion, rendering the function ineffective and potentially causing a DoS attack.
## Impact
The primary impact of this vulnerability is that it could lead to failed transactions due to out-of-gas conditions during the rewards distribution loop. As a result, the intended functionality of the `openPositionFarm` function, which includes opening a position, borrowing funds, adding liquidity, and distributing rewards, may not be successfully executed. This not only affects the user trying to perform the action but also prevents the proper functioning of the overall DeFi protocol and ecosystem.

## Recommendation
Implement batch processing for reward distribution within the loop. Instead of distributing rewards for each token individually, group them into batches and distribute rewards in a more efficient manner.
