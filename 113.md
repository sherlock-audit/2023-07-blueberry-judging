# onlyEOAEx can be bypassed
## Summary

onlyEOAEx modifier can be bypassed by using Create2

## Vulnerability Detail

'''solidity
if (AddressUpgradeable.isContract(msg.sender))
                revert Errors.NOT_EOA(msg.sender);
 '''

isContract can be tricked by precalculating salt for Create2 func.
And after bypassing onlyEOAEx modifier bytecode can be deployed on the address with recalculated salt.

## Impact

Some functions can become a target of reentrancy attack, for instance, with SafeTranferFrom for ERC1155, using onERC1155Received
