# Users will not receive their accrued rewards when they choose to close their positions from the `AuraSpell` contract
## Summary
The `closePositionFarm` function in the provided contract lacks a mechanism for distributing rewards to users when they close their positions. Unlike the `openPositionFarm` function, which includes a rewards distribution mechanism for users opening positions, the absence of such a mechanism in the `closePositionFarm` function can result in users not receiving their accrued rewards upon closing their positions.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `closePositionFarm` function is responsible for closing positions in the Aura protocol. However, it does not include a rewards distribution mechanism that compensates users for their participation in the protocol. While the function performs important actions such as burning wrapped tokens, repaying debts, and managing collateral, the crucial step of distributing rewards to users is missing.
```solidity
function closePositionFarm(
    ClosePosParam calldata param,
    uint256[] calldata expectedRewards,
    bytes[] calldata swapDatas
)
external
existingStrategy(param.strategyId)
existingCollateral(param.strategyId, param.collToken)
{
    // ... Other steps ...

    // No explicit rewards distribution mechanism present
}

```
## Impact
Users who have earned rewards by participating in the Aura protocol will not receive their accrued rewards when they choose to close their positions.

## Recommendation
Implement a rewards distribution mechanism within the `closePositionFarm` function making it essential to ensure that users receive their earned rewards when closing their positions.
