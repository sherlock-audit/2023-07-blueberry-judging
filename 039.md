# Possible Insufficient Liquidity due to single swap router in IchiSpell Contract
## Summary
 The IchiSpell contract's reliance on a single Uniswap V3 router for token swaps introduces potential issues related to insufficient liquidity. This issue could result in undesirable outcomes during token swaps, impacting users' trading experience and transaction costs.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_withdraw` function within the IchiSpell contract uses a single Uniswap V3 router, `uniV3Router`, for token swaps during the withdrawal process. While this simplifies code and provides predictability, it also means that token swaps are limited to the liquidity available on this specific router.
## Impact
Insufficient liquidity for the specified token pairs on the chosen Uniswap V3 router can lead to several negative consequences. Users may experience slippage, where executed trade prices deviate from expected prices. This could result in users receiving fewer tokens than anticipated, leading to higher trading costs and potential failed transactions.
