# Users can get front-run in `mint` Function of WAuraPools Contract
## Summary
The `mint` function within the `WAuraPools` contract, which is part of the Blueberry Protocol, is vulnerable to front-running attacks. This means that malicious actors can exploit the timing of transactions to manipulate the minting process, potentially leading to unfair rewards allocation for users depositing LP tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `mint` function in the `WAuraPools` contract is designed to wrap LP tokens, mint corresponding ERC1155 tokens, and handle rewards distribution. The function follows these steps:
- The user initiates a transaction to call the `mint` function, transferring LP tokens to the contract.
- The function interacts with the `auraPools` contract, depositing the LP tokens and handling rewards.
- An ERC1155 token is minted, representing the user's staked LP tokens along with associated rewards.</br>
The vulnerability arises due to the sequence of events and the potential for front-running attacks:
1. A user initiates the `mint` function transaction with a specified gas price.
2. An attacker closely monitors the mempool and quickly submits their own transaction with a higher gas price targeting the same `mint` function.
3. The attacker's transaction gets processed before the user's transaction due to the higher gas price. This gives the attacker a short window of opportunity to manipulate the minting process.
4. During the brief time frame before the user's transaction is processed, the attacker can potentially alter the rewards calculation mechanism. For instance, they might temporarily increase the `stAuraPerShare` value, which could result in the user receiving fewer rewards than they should.
## Impact
Unfair rewards allocation for users.

## Recommendation
Implement a gas price limit check in the `mint` function of the WAuraPools contract. Set a maximum acceptable gas price that users can include in their transactions.
