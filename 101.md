# CurveVolatileOracle#getPrice contains precision errors that heavily over values LP
## Summary

When calculating the price of underlying the price of underlying tokens are mistakenly scaled up another 10 dp even though base already returns the price to 18 dp.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/CurveVolatileOracle.sol#L109-L115

        uint256 product = (px0 * Constants.PRICE_PRECISION) / Constants.CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_PRECISION;
        product = product.mulDown((px1 * Constants.PRICE_PRECISION) / Constants.CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_PRECISION);

        if (nTokens == 3) {
            uint256 px2 = base.getPrice(tokens[2]);
            product = product.mulDown(
                (uint256(px2) * Constants.PRICE_PRECISION) / Constants.CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_PRECISION

When underlying tokens of the LP are priced they are multiplied by 1e18 then divided by 1e8. This scaled them up 10 dp. The issue with this is that base already returns the price to 18 dp. Due to this mistake the price of the LP is grossly over estimated allowing users to borrow much more than they should, leading to protocol insolvency.

## Impact

LP is overvalued leading to protocol insolvency

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

No need to convert pricing since base already returns the price to 18 dp
