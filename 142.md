# All closing positions, except for full exits, need to verify that their position size meets the minimum requirement set by `minPositionSize`
## Summary

All closing positions, except for full exits, need to verify that their position size meets the minimum requirement set by `minPositionSize`

## Vulnerability Detail

In this Blueberry update every strategy now have minimum position size that need to be respected. As we can see from this `addStrategy` function there is now `minPosSize`.

```solidity
    function addStrategy(
        address crvLp,
        uint256 minPosSize,
        uint256 maxPosSize
    ) external onlyOwner {
        _addStrategy(crvLp, minPosSize, maxPosSize);
    }
```

But here, the check of this `minPositionSize` in `_validatePosSize` only called on `openPositionFarm` and `openPosition`

This check should also performed on any close position, the `closePositionFarm` & `closePosition` in case user close some amount (not fully close their position). If user want to close full position then the check should be skipped.

## Impact

There will be position which its size is under `minPositionSize`, a dust position will occure, which might not be expected by protocol, or may raise derivative issues

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider to add `_validatePosSize` in any close position function, but make sure the close position is a partial close, because if user want to full exit, they should clear up their position.
