# The `burn` function of WAuraPools and WConvexPools contracts can become stuck with zero reward transfer, potentially blocking reward retrieval and the overall burning operation.
## Summary
The `burn` function of WAuraPools and WConvexPools contracts can become stuck with zero reward transfer, potentially blocking reward retrieval and the overall burning operation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `burn` function of WAuraPools and WConvexPools contracts lacks checks for the amounts to be transferred. The function proceeds to send the amounts to the `msg.sender` without checking if the amount is zero or not (At `<= FOUND`s). Some ERC20s do not allow zero amounts to be sent: https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers. This can cause the `burn` function to become stuck with zero reward transfer, effectively blocking the process of reward retrieval and token burning in general.

// Findings are labeled with '<= FOUND'
// File: blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WAuraPools.sol
360:    function burn(
361:        ...
413:        uint256 rewardTokensLength = rewardTokens.length;
414:        for (uint256 i; i != rewardTokensLength; ) {
415:            IERC20Upgradeable(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(
416:                msg.sender,
417:                rewards[i] // <= FOUND: WAuraPools & WConvexPools's burn can become stuck with zero reward transfer
418:            );
419:
420:            unchecked {
421:                ++i;
422:            }
423:        }
424:    }
// File: blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WConvexPools.sol
276:    function burn(
277:        ...
327:        uint rewardLen = rewardTokens.length;
328:        for (uint i; i < rewardLen; ) {
329:            IERC20Upgradeable(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(
330:                msg.sender,
331:                rewards[i] // <= FOUND
332:            );
333:
334:            unchecked {
335:                ++i;
336:            }
337:        }
338:    }
```

## Impact
If a reward token that disallows zero amount transfers is included in the reward list and a zero incentive amount is earned, the entire `burn` call will revert. This can lead to the burning process being blocked until the problematic token is removed from the pool's reward token list or until some non-zero reward amount is earned. Since the burning operation is a fundamental functionality for the system, its availability is affected by this issue.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check for non-zero amounts before performing transfers in the `burn` function of WAuraPools & WConvexPools contracts.
