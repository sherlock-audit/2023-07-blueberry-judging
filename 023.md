# Hardcoded deadline to `block.timestamp` can cause loss of funds
## Summary
Deadline in `IchiSpell._withdraw` is hardcoded to block.timestamp, that can cause loss of funds for the user and will potentially  expose the protocol to sanwich attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
IUniswapV3Router.ExactInputSingleParams
                memory params = IUniswapV3Router.ExactInputSingleParams({
                    tokenIn: swapPath[0],
                    tokenOut: swapPath[1],
                    fee: IUniswapV3Pool(vault.pool()).fee(),
                    recipient: address(this),
                    deadline: block.timestamp, //@audit 
                    amountIn: amountIn,
                    amountOutMinimum: param.amountOutMin, //@audit from where did we get amountOut
                    sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0 
                });
```

In `IchiSpell._withdraw`, there is a parameter to allow users to supply slippage through `amountOutMinimum` but does not allow user to include a deadline check when Swapping withdrawn tokens to debt token.

```solidity
                    deadline: block.timestamp, //@audit 
```

In `IchiSpell._withdraw`, there is a call to `IUniswapV3Router.ExactInputSingleParams()` but the deadline parameter is simply passed in as current block.timestamp in which transaction occurs. This effectively means that transaction has no deadline, which means that swap transaction may be included anytime by validators and remain pending in mempool, potentially exposing users to sandwich attacks by attackers or MEV bots.

### Consider the following scenario:

1): Alice wants to swap 30 vBNB token for 1 BNB and later sell the 1 BNB for 300 DAI. She signs the transaction calling 
    `IchiSpell._withdraw` with inputAmount = 30 vBNB and amountOutmin = 0.99 BNB to allow for 1% slippage.

2. The transaction is submitted to the mempool, however, Alice chose a transaction fee that is too low for validators to be 
interested in including her transaction in a block. The transaction stays pending in the mempool for extended periods, which could be hours, days, weeks, or even longer.
4. When the average gas fee dropped far enough for Alice's transaction to become interesting again for miners to include it, her swap will be executed. In the meantime, the price of BNB could have drastically decreased. She will still at least get 0.99 BNB due to `amountOutmin`, but the DAI value of that output might be significantly lower. She has unknowingly performed a bad trade due to the pending transaction she forgot about.

An even worse way this issue can be maliciously exploited is through MEV:

1. The swap transaction is still pending in the mempool. Average fees are still too high for validators to be interested in it. The price of BNB has gone up significantly since the transaction was signed, meaning Alice would receive a lot more ETH when the swap is executed. But that also means that her minOutput value is outdated and would allow for significant slippage.

2. A MEV bot detects the pending transaction. Since the outdated `minOut` now allows for high slippage, the bot sandwiches Alice, resulting in significant profit for the bot and significant loss for Alice.

## Impact
Not allowing users to supply their own deadline could potentially expose them to sandwich attacks
