# Wrong precision in ChainlinkAdapterOracleL2.getPrice function
## Summary
`ChainlinkAdapterOracleL2.getPrice(address token_)` function computes and returns USD price of the specified token with a fixed/ hardcoded precision of 8 decimal. However, certain tokens in chainlink price feed have different decimal precision. This results in wrong calculation of token price in USD.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkAdapterOracleL2.sol#L105-L147

In line 144-146, `Constants.CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_PRECISION` is used as precision factor for Chainlink price feed values. The `BlueBerryConst.sol` file sets its value to 8 i.e `CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_PRECISION = 1e8`.

However, there exist tokens which has USD price precision higher than 8 decimals, such as `AMPL / USD` pair has [price precision of 18 decimals](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses) ([contract link](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe20CA8D7546932360e37E9D72c1a47334af57706#readContract#F3))

Moreover, chainlink web states [Each feed uses a different number of decimal places for answers](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/using-data-feeds#:~:text=Each%20feed%20uses%20a%20different%20number%20of%20decimal%20places%20for%20answers). Therefore, fixed 8 decimal precision cannot be used for each token.

## Impact
1. Wrong calculation of token price in USD.
2. Makes the project inconsistent.
3. Funds may lost as user may withdraw more OR deposit lesser than required.

## Tool used
VS Code and Manual Review

## Recommendation
Store the decimals for each token or fetch it from price feed.
