# `ensureApprove` will revert for non-standard ERC20 tokens like USDT
## Summary
`ensureApprove` will revert for non-standard ERC20 tokens like USDT

## Vulnerability Detail
The token approval calls the `approve` function from IERC20.sol, which expects a boolean as a return value. However, USDT token is non-standard and doesn't return a boolean value, so the compiler will throw an error for USDT token.

## Impact
The strategy won't work with USDT tokens on Ethereum mainnet.
