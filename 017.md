# `closePositionFarm` in  `AuraSpell.sol`  doesn't use any real slippage protection when `exitPool` is called which can lead to loss of funds
## Summary
`closePositionFarm` is used to remove an amount from a `Balancer` pool but the `minAmountsOut` array calculated will always have 0 values, which can lead to loss of funds since no slippage protection is used.
## Vulnerability Detail
`closePositionFarm` calls `_getExitPoolParams` to calculate `minAmountsOut`, `tokens` and `borrowTokenIndex`

In that function the `minAmountsOut` gets created with the same length as the `tokens` array 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/AuraSpell.sol#L360-L361
but it is never populated with any value, which means the the `minAmountsOut` gets set to 0 values on every index.
Because of that `minAmountsOut` with 0 values will be passed into `exitPool` and no amount of slippage protection will exist, which can lead to sandwich attacks and loss of funds for the protocol

## Impact
Impact is a high one since it can involve loss of funds to the protocol.

## Recommendation
Use some slippage protection when removing liquidity from the balancer pools since it can risk the protocol funds.
