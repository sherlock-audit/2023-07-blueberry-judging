# Unauthorized Collateral Withdrawal Due to Missing Access Control in `BlueBerryBank`
## Summary
Unauthorized Access to Collateral Withdrawal Function

## Vulnerability Detail
BlueBerryBank` contract includes a function named `takeCollateral` which allows users to withdraw collateral from their positions. However, the function lacks proper access control mechanisms, enabling any user to call the function and withdraw collateral from any position, including positions that do not belong to them. This constitutes an unauthorized access vulnerability, potentially leading to theft of collateral.

## Impact
The lack of access control allows malicious actors to exploit the contract and steal collateral from positions that do not belong to them. This can result in financial loss for affected users and undermine the trust in the contract's security.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One possible approach is to introduce an `onlyPositionOwner` modifier that ensures the sender of the transaction is the owner of the position associated with the collateral. Here is an example of how the function can be modified:

```solidity
modifier onlyPositionOwner(uint256 positionId) {
    require(msg.sender == positions[positionId].owner, "Not the position owner");
    _;
}

function takeCollateral(uint256 amount) external override inExec onlyPositionOwner(POSITION_ID) returns (uint256) {
    Position storage pos = positions[POSITION_ID];
    // Rest of the function remains the same
    // ...
}
```
