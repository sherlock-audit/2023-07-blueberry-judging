# Underflow problems occurring when a token has >18 decimals
## Summary
This report outlines a vulnerability discovered in the getPrice function of the provided code. The vulnerability involves potential underflow issues during calculations, particularly when dealing with tokens that have more than 18 decimals. The report provides details about the vulnerability, its impact, a relevant code snippet, the methodology used to identify the issue, and recommendations to mitigate the risk.

## Vulnerability Detail
The getPrice function performs complex calculations involving token balances, weights, and prices. However, the code does not adequately handle tokens with decimals exceeding 18 that  might lead to underflow while Adjusting token balances based on decimals 
(balances[i] * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(tokens[i]).decimals())).

This is the case e.g. for NEAR which is divisible into 10e24 yocto

## Impact
If the code processes tokens with decimals exceeding 18, it might lead to severe underflow issues during calculations. This could result in inaccurate or inconsistent USD value calculations, compromising the reliability of the getPrice function's output.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/WeightedBPTOracle.sol#L59

 
    function getPrice(address token) external override returns (uint256) {
        ....
            invariant = invariant.mulDown(
                (balances[i] * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(tokens[i]).decimals()))
                .powDown(weights[i])
            );
           ..
         }

here as well if the 2 tokens have a sum of decimals > 36
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/UniswapV2Oracle.sol#L57


    function getPrice(address pair) external override returns (uint256) {
        ...
        uint256 t0Decimal = IERC20Metadata(token0).decimals();
        uint256 t1Decimal = IERC20Metadata(token1).decimals();
        uint256 sqrtK = BBMath.sqrt(
            r0 * r1 * 10 ** (36 - t0Decimal - t1Decimal)
        );
       ...
      }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update calculations in the contract to account for tokens with decimals higher than 18.
