# `getPrice` in `CurveTricryptoOracle.sol` assumes that the ETH will always be the third token which is not the case all the time.
## Summary
`getPrice` is calculating the price of Curve LP tokens from tricrypto pools, which hold 3 tokens, and it wrongly assume that the 3'rd token will always be ETH which is not the case for every pool.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function it checks that the `token.lenght` is equal to 3 and checks the price of the 3rd tokens which it assumes all the time that it is ETH

but as you can see there are pools on mainnet that does not have the last token ETH like

or

Also for the case of Arbitrum, since the project is deployed also on Arbitrum, there is no tricrypto pool with ETH being the last token, so assuming that all the time can lead to wrong calculations in the `getPrice` function. 
## Impact
Impact is a medium one since it can lead to wrong calculations and price assumptions.

## Recommendation
Instead of assuming all the time that last token is ETH , check where ETH is by calling `coins` view function function on the curve pools that you interacting with.
