# Uncorrect price calculation when l2 sequencer goes down

## Summary

Uncorrect token price calculation when l2 sequencer goes down may cause contract assets stolen.


## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, BandAdapterOracle#getPrice and ChainlinkAdapterOracle#getPrice use `block.timestamp` to judge whether token price outdated or not, but it's vulnerable when l2 sequencer goes down.

However, it's vulnerable when l2 sequencer goes down cause that `block.timestamp` is unusable. L2 chains like arbitrum and optimsm upgrade their sequencer occasional, such as the recent [optimism bedrock upgrade](https://cryptopotato.com/optimism-bedrock-upgrade-release-date-revealed/) cause the sequencer can't be able to process transactions for several hours. Or l2 sequencer bug could also cause transactions in stuck, such as [arbitrum sequencer bug](https://beincrypto.com/arbitrum-sequencer-bug-causes-temporary-transaction-pause/). So it's necessary to implement an mechanism to handle this issue in some abnormal conditions. 


## Impact

Token asset price calculation will be uncorrect and may cause contract asset stolen.

## Tool used

vscode, Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use chainlink [sequencer up feed](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds), consider integrating the up time feed and give the contract extra time to mint token normally when l2 sequencer goes down.
