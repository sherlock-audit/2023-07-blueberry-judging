# Curve Oracle Susceptible to price manipulation
## Summary
The curve oracle relies on the `virtual lp price` by calling the Curve `get_virtual_price_from_lp_token` function.

This data is based on on-chain pool reserves from Curve, leaving it susceptible to manipulation via flash loans or MEV.

## Vulnerability Detail
Attackers can conduct flash loans to skew the pool balances on Curve, if the Curve LP is an ETH pool, it is also susceptible to read-only reentrancy's by compounding the ETH balances inside the attacker's fallback function when calling the Curve `remove_liquidity` or `exchange` function, skewering the `virtual lp price` price further.

## Impact
Loss of funds, as a lending protocol relies on accurate prices to determine liquidations & a user's borrowing power.

## Code Snippet

Fetching the `virtual LP Price`:

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/CurveBaseOracle.sol#L102-L103
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/CurveBaseOracle.sol#L118-L119

Then calculating the USD price using the `virtual LP Price`:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are 2 ways you can fix this.

**1. Adding a `_checkAndUpperBoundValue` function:**
Consider adding this code snippet: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/CurveVolatileOracle.sol#L133-L143

to the `CurveStableOracle.sol` & `CurveTricryptoOracle.sol` as well.

**2. Use a combination of Chainlink & Uniswap TWAP with the `virtual lp price`** :
This solution was inspired by Frax Finance where they used a combination of all 3 oracles to ensure an accurate price of Curve LP
