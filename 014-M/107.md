# Issue #145 from Update #1 is still present in IchiSpell
## Summary

Issue [145](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry-judging/issues/145) from Update 1 has not been fixed. Using block.timestamp is equivalent to using no deadline at all. This is because block.timestamp is relative and always "now", which means it can never be in the past and can therefore never be expired.
