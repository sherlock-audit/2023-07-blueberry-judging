# CurveTricryptoOracle incorrectly assumes that WETH is always the last token in the pool which leads to bad LP pricing
## Summary

CurveTricryptoOracle assumes that WETH is always the last token in the pool (`tokens[2]`). This is incorrect for a majority of tricrypto pools and will lead to LP being highly overvalued.

## Vulnerability Detail

[CurveTricryptoOracle.sol#L53-L63](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/CurveTricryptoOracle.sol#L53-L63)

        if (tokens.length == 3) {
            /// tokens[2] is WETH
            uint256 ethPrice = base.getPrice(tokens[2]);
            return
                (lpPrice(
                    virtualPrice,
                    base.getPrice(tokens[1]),
                    ethPrice,
                    base.getPrice(tokens[0])
                ) * 1e18) / ethPrice;
        }

When calculating LP prices, CurveTricryptoOracle#getPrice always assumes that WETH is the second token in the pool. This isn't the case which will cause the LP to be massively overvalued.

There are 6 tricrypto pools currently deployed on mainnet. Half of these pools have an asset other than WETH as token[2]:

        0x4ebdf703948ddcea3b11f675b4d1fba9d2414a14 - CRV
        0x5426178799ee0a0181a89b4f57efddfab49941ec - INV
        0x2889302a794da87fbf1d6db415c1492194663d13 - wstETH

## Impact

LP will be massively overvalued leading to overborrowing and protocol insolvency

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There is no need to assume that WETH is the last token. Simply pull the price for each asset and input it into lpPrice.
