# usage of type(uint).max to represent an unset reward per share can lead to overflow errors
## Summary
The usage of the type(uint).max value to represent an unset reward per share can potentially lead to overflow errors
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that type(uint).max represents the maximum possible uint value (2**256 - 1). If a reward per share ever exceeds this value, it will overflow and be stored as a small number.
For example, if the actual reward per share is 2**256, it will overflow and be stored as 0. Then when calculating pending rewards, it will incorrectly use 0 instead of the actual high value, severely underpaying the user.
Example:
1. User mints a token when rewardPerShare is very high, close to 2**256.
2. This overflows and stores rewardPerShare as 0 in accExtPerShare mapping.
3. Later, when user burns token, pendingRewards uses the 0 value instead of actual high value.
4. User gets paid much less rewards than expected.

## Impact
contract failing to pay out the full pending rewards owed to the user.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A separate boolean flag can be used to track whether a reward is set or unset, instead of overloading the reward value itself
