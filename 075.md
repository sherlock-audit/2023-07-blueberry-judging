# Incorrect Assumption of Return Data in swap Function Leads to Denial of Service on Arbitrum
## Summary
The `PSwapLib` library incorrectly assumes that any return data from the `augustusSwapper` indicates a failed transaction. While this assumption holds true on `Ethereum`, it does not on `Arbitrum`, leading to unintended reverts and a denial of service in functionalities that utilize `Paraswap` for token swapping on the Arbitrum network.

## Vulnerability Detail
The` swap` function in the library calls the `augustusSwapper` and checks for return data. If any return data is present, the function assumes the transaction has failed and reverts:

```javascript=31
    (success, returndata) = augustusSwapper.call(data);

    if (returndata.length > 0) {
        assembly {
            let returndata_size := mload(returndata)
            revert(add(32, returndata), returndata_size)
        }
    }
```
On Ethereum, the `AugustusSwapper` does not return any data upon a successful transaction, making the above logic valid. However, on Arbitrum, the `AugustusSwapper` returns the `receivedAmount` even on successful transactions. This discrepancy means that the current implementation will always consider the call as failed on` Arbitrum` and revert, even when the transaction was successful.

## Impact
This incorrect assumption results in a denial of service for all functionalities of the contract (Spells) that rely on Paraswap for token swapping when operating on the Arbitrum network. Users will be unable to successfully swap tokens, leading to potential financial losses, user dissatisfaction, and reduced trust in the platform.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The presence of return data should not automatically trigger a revert. Instead, the success variable should be checked to determine the outcome of the transaction.
