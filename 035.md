# Inaccurate Risk Calculation Could Lead to Premature Liquidation
## Summary
The issue stems from the `getPositionRisk()` function, which calculates risk for positions that can be liquidated. The calculation involves the `cv (collateral value)`, a critical component. The vulnerability arises because the function `getIsolatedCollateralValue()` uses the `exchangeRateStored()` method from Compound's CToken contract, which does not account for accrued interest before calculating the exchange rate. As a result, the risk calculation could be inaccurate, potentially leading to premature liquidation of positions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol relies on the `isLiquidatable()` function to determine if a position is eligible for liquidation. This function depends on the `getPositionRisk()` function to calculate risk. The critical factor in the risk calculation is `cv (collateral value)`, which is determined by the `getIsolatedCollateralValue()` function. This function employs the `exchangeRateStored()` method from Compound's CToken contract to compute the exchange rate. However, this method doesn't incorporate accrued interest before making the calculation.

## Impact
The vulnerability can lead to incorrect risk assessments for positions within the protocol. As a result, positions that are still healthy and adequately collateralized might be falsely categorized as risky and liquidated prematurely. This issue could adversely affect users' positions, causing them to lose assets unnecessarily due to inaccurate risk calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is advised to address the vulnerability by using the `exchangeRateCurrent()` method instead of `exchangeRateStored()` when calculating the collateral value in the `getIsolatedCollateralValue()` function
