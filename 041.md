# Adding Liquidity To Curve Pools Has Possibility of Silently Failing
## Summary
Some of the older Vyper Contract Pools used by Curve has the risk of silently failing when calling with an incorrect or non-existent function signatures.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some of the Curve.add_liquidity() function interfaces used in the Curve & Convex spell are incorrect, but will not revert properly even though the function does not exist on the Curve pool Contract.

Particularly with some of the older ETH pools such as the Curve/ETH Pool. This is due to an older version of Vyper.

I was not able to git push my Proof-of-Concept to this repo, but feel free to let me know and I can set up a separate repo for this POC.

## Impact
When calling a non-existing function, some of the vyper contracts will fail silently instead of reverting, this means token transfers are actually done into the Spell contract which can mess up internal accounting providing incorrect balances to users, and also having funds stuck in the Contract as the add_liquidity will not revert properly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To check for this kind of error, it is recommended to check if the minLpAmount was actually minted to the contract, by updating the current `ICurvePool.add_liquidity` interface to the following:

`function add_liquidity(uint256[2] calldata, uint256) external returns (uint256);`

Then, when calling the `add_liquidity` function in the Spell contracts, save the returned `lpMinted` amount and do a require check after calling `add_liquidity`, for example:

```solidity
uint256 lpMinted =  ICurvePool(pool).add_liquidity(suppliedAmts, minLPMint);
require(lpMinted >= minLPMint, "Insufficient LP Amount");
```
