# reentrancy vulnerability in the _doERC20TransferIn and _doERC1155TransferIn functions
## Summary
There is a reentrancy vulnerability in the _doERC20TransferIn and _doERC1155TransferIn functions. The issue is that these functions first call transferFrom on an external token contract to transfer tokens into the BlueBerryBank contract, and only afterwards update the internal balances.

## Vulnerability Detail
The key issue is that these functions call transferFrom on external tokens to transfer tokens into the contract, before updating the internal balances. This means that if the token contract is malicious, it could make a recursive call back into BlueBerryBank to drain funds before the balances are updated.
Here is how it could be exploited:
1. Attacker calls execute() to enter execution mode
2. Attacker calls _doERC20TransferIn() or _doERC1155TransferIn(), specifying a malicious token contract they control
3. The function calls transferFrom on the malicious token
4. The malicious token's transferFrom implementation recursively calls back into BlueBerryBank, e.g. calling takeCollateral()
5. Since balances weren't updated yet, takeCollateral still sees the old balances and allows draining more tokens
6. Repeat steps 4-5 recursively until drained

## Impact
Attackers can drain funds from BlueBerryBank by recursively calling back in before internal state is updated

## Recommendation
 update the balances before calling the external transferFrom
