# IchiSpell#_deposit: `ichiVaultShare` local variable isn't actually used anywhere other than being assigned the result of the vault.deposit.
## Summary
I know only H/M findings, but this should probably be reported and looked at, and I obviously dont expect any rewards for this.

## Vulnerability Detail
N/A

## Impact
QA/GAS only.

## Code Snippet
L118-L123

        uint ichiVaultShare;
        if (isTokenA) {
            ichiVaultShare = vault.deposit(borrowBalance, 0, address(this));
        } else {
            ichiVaultShare = vault.deposit(0, borrowBalance, address(this));
        }

## Tool used
VSC, Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should/can be changed to:

        if (isTokenA) {
            vault.deposit(borrowBalance, 0, address(this));
        } else {
            vault.deposit(0, borrowBalance, address(this));
        }
