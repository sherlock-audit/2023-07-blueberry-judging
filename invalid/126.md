# The success flag of `augustusSwapper.call(data)` isn't checked.
## Summary
The success flag of `augustusSwapper.call(data)` isn't checked. Which might fail silently returning `returndata` containing an empty bytes array (bytes memory with length 0).

## Vulnerability Detail
In library `PSwapLib`, the function `swap` uses a low level call `.call` 
`(success, returndata) = augustusSwapper.call(data);` (line 31)
which might just fail without reverting silently.which makes the `returndata` containing nothing.
 

## Impact
The low level call will just fail silently without returning any value.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The mitigation steps as follows:
1. Add this line check the low level call success flag
```solidity 
if (!success) {
    // Handle the case where the external function call failed
    revert("External call failed");
}

```
