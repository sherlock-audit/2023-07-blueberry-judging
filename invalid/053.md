# Contract Might Fail to Approve withdrawal from HardVault for Lender
## Summary
Contract Might Fail to Approve withdrawal from HardVault for Lender in the withdrawLend(...) function of the BlueBerryBank.sol Contract
## Vulnerability Detail
The function responsible for Lendered amount withdrawal by Lender from L720-L748 of the BlueBerryBank.sol Contract, the  withdrawLend(...) function after validating all necessary checks has a flaw when lender wants to withdraw from HardVault as no approval is done before continuation of this function call after L737.
```solidity
        } else {
            wAmount = IHardVault(bank.hardVault).withdraw(token, shareAmount);
        }
```
One problem from not using _ensureApprove() is that the contract might fail to approve the lender withdrawal for the correct amount of tokens, which could lead to unexpected errors or security issues. Another problem is that the contract might waste gas due to absence of adequate approval, which could reduce its efficiency and performance.

To avoid these problems, it is recommended to use _ensureApprove in smart contracts that need to grant approval for a lender withdrawal. This function ensures that the approval is done only once and with the correct amount.
## Impact
 withdrawLend(...) function of the BlueBerryBank.sol Contract Might Fail to Approve withdrawal from HardVault for Lender or wrong amount withdrawal due to inapproval
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L733-L737
```solidity
    function withdrawLend(
        address token,
        uint256 shareAmount
    ) external override inExec poke(token) {
        if (!isWithdrawLendAllowed()) revert Errors.WITHDRAW_LEND_NOT_ALLOWED();
        Position storage pos = positions[POSITION_ID];
        Bank memory bank = banks[token];
        if (token != pos.underlyingToken) revert Errors.INVALID_UTOKEN(token);
        if (shareAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            shareAmount = pos.underlyingVaultShare;
        }

        uint256 wAmount;
        if (_isSoftVault(token)) {
            _ensureApprove(bank.softVault, bank.softVault, shareAmount);
            wAmount = ISoftVault(bank.softVault).withdraw(shareAmount);
        } else {
            wAmount = IHardVault(bank.hardVault).withdraw(token, shareAmount);
        }
...
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
IERC20 approval should be set for the withdrawal from HardVault not just the SoftVault
```solidity
        if (_isSoftVault(token)) {
            _ensureApprove(bank.softVault, bank.softVault, shareAmount);
            wAmount = ISoftVault(bank.softVault).withdraw(shareAmount);
        } else {
+++    _ensureApprove(bank.hardVault, bank.hardVault, shareAmount);
            wAmount = IHardVault(bank.hardVault).withdraw(token, shareAmount);
        }
```
