# Unattended sequential approval reset and set in `_ensureApprove` function leading to possible race condition and re-approval attacks given a spender with unlimited victim allowance
## Summary

The `EnsureApprove.sol` contract exposes token holders to race condition exploits and re-approval attack vectors. The `_ensureApprove` function sequentially resets a spender's allowance to zero before establishing a new allowance. Although the window of vulnerability between these operations is minuscule, it might be exploited if a malicious actor can observe and act upon transactions in the mempool.

## Vulnerability Detail

> The `_ensureApprove` function in `EnsureApprove.sol` is structured as follows:

1. Reset the spender's allowance to 0 with `IERC20(token).approve(spender, 0);` (although this is a pattern recommended by the ERC20 standard to avoid race conditions, in this scenario it introduces a new risk)

2. Right after, set the spender's allowance to the specified `amount` using `IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount);`

> The risks of this structure include:

- **Race Conditions**: While theoretically possible, the real-world chance is minuscule. However, if two transactions try adjusting the approval for the same token and spender simultaneously, one transaction might fail due to interference from the other. This can inflate gas expenditures and result in txn failures.

- **Re-approval Attack Vector**: More feasible than the race condition. Attackers monitoring the mempool can exploit the tiny vulnerability window. If a user once gave an unlimited allowance to a potentially malicious contract, an attacker might drain tokens by using the old allowance value between the two `approve` calls in `_ensureApprove`.

## Impact

- Users might lose their tokens in a re-approval attack.
- Race conditions could lead to higher gas costs and transaction failures.
- Risky unpredictability when interacting with contracts employing this function.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _ensureApprove(
 address token,
 address spender,
 uint256 amount
) internal {
 IERC20(token).approve(spender, 0);  // Vulnerable window starts
 IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount);  // Vulnerable window ends
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. **Conditional Check Before Resetting Approval**: Before resetting the approval, add a check to verify the current allowance. If it matches the desired amount, there is no need to modify anything. This can avoid unnecessary operations and the risk associated with them.

```solidity
uint256 currentAllowance = IERC20(token).allowance(address(this), spender);
if (currentAllowance == amount) {
    return; // No changes required
}
```

2. **Single Atomic Transaction to Reduce Vulnerability Window**: If there is a need to reset and then set a new approval, consider using a delegatecall to a contract that performs both operations atomically. By keeping these operations in a single transaction, the window of vulnerability is minimized.

```solidity
uint256 currentAllowance = IERC20(token).allowance(address(this), spender);
if (currentAllowance != amount) {
    if (currentAllowance > 0) {
        IERC20(token).approve(spender, 0);
    }
    IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount);
}
```

> This ensures that if the allowance needs to change, it is first set to zero (if not already zero) and then set to the desired value, in two separate transactions. While this does not entirely eliminate the race condition, it's a standard ERC20 behavior and front-running this would be difficult.

## Proof Of Concept

> **While the following scenario relies on a user giving unlimited allowance, which is not typical, it's still quite a risk. Some dApps or platforms might encourage or design their systems in a way that unlimited approvals are set, especially in high-frequency transaction environments.**

**Re-approval Attack Vector**:

1. Alice possesses an ERC20 token (`tokenA`) and previously provided a malicious contract (`spenderContract`) with unlimited access.
2. Deciding to modify this allowance, Alice engages a contract using the `EnsureApprove` logic.
3. Alice activates a function that internally invokes `_ensureApprove`.
4. An attacker, having access to `spenderContract` and actively monitoring the mempool, dispatches a high-gas transaction to exploit Alice's old, unlimited `spenderContract` allowance for her `tokenA`.
5. If the attacker's transaction is mined amidst the two `approve` calls of `_ensureApprove`, Alice's holdings of `tokenA` can be exploited using the previous unlimited allowance.
