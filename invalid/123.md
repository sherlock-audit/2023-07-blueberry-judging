# Curve MetaPool Registry is incorrectly added in `addressProvider.get_address()`
## Summary
The function `_getPoolInfo` fetches the curve pool information for a given Curve LP token address. The meta pool address is wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail
In abstract contract `CurveBaseOracle`, the function `_getPoolInfo` fetcehs curve pool information for three different Curve LP.  _main curve registry and CryptoSwap curve registry_ addresses are implemented correctly but in case of _meta curve registry_ the address is incorrect. (Line 108)

## Impact
The attempt of retrival from Meta Curve Registry will fail.
