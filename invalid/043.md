# PSwap Library Swap could revert incorrectly.
## Summary
PSwap Library does not properly check for successful/unsuccessful swaps.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside the `PSwapLib.sol` file, there is a function called `swap`, which uses the `augustusSwapper.call` function to manage multiple swaps.

Calling that function will return a `(bool success, bytes returndata)` data.

The function will then check for an error `if (returndata.length > 0)`, and if there is some returnData, the function will revert.

This could result in incorrect reverts, even though the swap actually went through, simply because there was returnData such as the `swapOutAmount` that is commonly returned by most DEXes after conducting a swap function.

## Impact
This could cause incorrect reverts, making a transaction not possible, potentially leaving user funds stuck.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do a check by checking the boolean `success` variable first then only the `returndata` later on.

```solidity
if (!success) {
    if (returndata.length == 0) revert ExecutionFailed();

    assembly {
        revert(add(returndata.length, returndata), mload(returndata))
     }
}
```
