# race condition in the mint() function could allow a malicious user to manipulate the approval.
## Summary
The mint() function approves the cvxPools contract to spend the LP tokens using _ensureApprove() before depositing. There is a race condition where cvxPools could potentially spend the approval between the approve and deposit calls. This could be manipulated by the user.
## Vulnerability Detail
there is a potential race condition in the mint() function related to approving and depositing LP tokens. Here is a summary:
_ensureApprove() is called first to approve cvxPools to spend the LP tokens: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WConvexPools.sol#L248). Then cvxPools.deposit() is called to deposit the tokens: [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WConvexPools.sol#L249)
There is a window between the approve and deposit where a malicious user could call transferFrom() on the LP token contract to transfer the tokens elsewhere before they are deposited. This is because the approval is still valid after _ensureApprove() and before deposit().

The flow is:

1. Transfer LP tokens to this contract
2. Approve cvxPools to spend amount of LP tokens
3. Deposit LP tokens to cvxPools

The race condition is between steps 2 and 3.

After approving cvxPools in step 2, there is a window where cvxPools can call transferFrom to take the LP tokens before they are deposited in step 3.

A malicious user could exploit this by:

- Approving cvxPools to spend LP tokens
- Calling mint() - this will approve cvxPools again
- In the window between steps 2 and 3, call transferFrom on cvxPools to take the LP tokens
- When deposit is called, the tokens are gone
- This results in loss of funds as the user's LP tokens are stolen

## Impact
- The race condition allows tokens to potentially be stolen after approval but before deposit.
- A malicious user could monitor for approvals and front-run the deposit call.

## Recommendation
approve max uint and then reset allowance to 0 after deposit:
