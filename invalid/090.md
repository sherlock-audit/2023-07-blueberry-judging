# `ChainlinkAdapterOracleL2` Susceptible to DoS Due to Lack of Error Handling
## Summary
The `ChainlinkAdapterOracleL2` contract, designed to fetch price data from Chainlink's data feeds on Layer 2 networks, lacks adequate error handling and fallback logic. Specifically, the contract heavily relies on Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` function to retrieve the latest price data. However, without proper error handling, this reliance poses a risk of potential denial of service (DoS) attacks. If the contract's access to the Chainlink data feed is denied or encounters an error, the contract will revert, leading to a potential permanent disruption in querying prices.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the `getPrice` function within the `ChainlinkAdapterOracleL2` contract. This function employs the Chainlink `latestRoundData()` function to fetch price information. However, it does not implement any fallback mechanism to handle situations where access to the Chainlink data feed is denied. Consequently, if the Chainlink multisigs decide to block the contract's access to the data feed, the contract will permanently fail to query prices, rendering it unable to provide accurate price information.\
```solidity
// Vulnerable function in ChainlinkAdapterOracleL2 contract
function getPrice(address token_) external view override returns (uint256) {
    // ...

    // Fetch L2 sequencer status
    (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, , ) = sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData();

    // ...

    // Fetch the price from the Chainlink feed
    (uint80 roundID, int256 price, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = AggregatorV3Interface(priceFeed).latestRoundData();

    // ...

    return (price.toUint256() * Constants.PRICE_PRECISION) / Constants.CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_PRECISION;
}
```
## Impact
 Price data unavailability hampers value assessments and triggers operational instability, causing economic disruptions.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract should implement proper error handling and fallback logic within the `getPrice` function.
