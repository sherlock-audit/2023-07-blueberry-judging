# Inaccurate ICHI Reward Transfers in the `burn` function
## Summary
 The `burn` function in the provided contract contains a vulnerability that can result in incorrect token transfers due to the approach used to limit the transfer amount. This limitation could lead to either over-transfers or under-transfers of `ICHI rewards` to users during the redemption process.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is centered around the following code snippet in the burn function:
```solidity
if (rewards[0] > 0) {
    ICHI.safeTransfer(
        msg.sender,
        ICHI.balanceOf(address(this)) >= rewards[0]
            ? rewards[0]
            : ICHI.balanceOf(address(this))
    );
}
```
In this code, the intention is to transfer ICHI rewards to the user, while ensuring that the transfer amount doesn't exceed the balance of ICHI tokens held by the contract. However, using the contract's balance as a condition to determine the transfer amount is not robust and could lead to inaccurate transfers.
## Impact
`Over-Transfers:` If the contract's balance changes between the time of checking the balance and the time of transferring tokens, the transfer amount might exceed the user's actual rewards, causing over-transfers of ICHI tokens.

`Under-Transfers:` Conversely, if the contract's balance decreases between the balance check and the transfer, the user might receive fewer ICHI tokens than they are entitled to, leading to under-transfers.

## Recommendation
Mitigation Approach: Ensure Approval and Exact Transfer Amount
```solidity
if (rewards[0] > 0) {
    // Ensure approval for the exact transfer amount
    _ensureApprove(address(ICHI), msg.sender, rewards[0]);
    ICHI.safeTransfer(msg.sender, rewards[0]);
}
```
By ensuring that the exact transfer amount is approved and transferred, the mitigation eliminates the need for checking the contract's balance and mitigates the potential for over-transfers or under-transfers.
