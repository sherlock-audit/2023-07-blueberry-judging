# manipulation of debt shares in _repay.
## Summary
The issue comes from calculating the reduced debt share (lessShare) based on the total shares and total debt.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability comes from calculating the reduced debt share (lessShare) based on the total shares and total debt. An attacker could artificially inflate the total shares for a token without changing the total debt.
For example, say the actual total debt is 100 tokens with 10 total shares. The attacker's position has a debt share of 1, representing 10 tokens of debt.
The attacker borrows an additional 100 tokens, doubling the total debt to 200. But instead of minting 10 more shares to match, the attacker mints 100 more shares, making the total shares 110.
When the attacker repays their 10 tokens of debt, the reduced debt share will be calculated as (10 * 110) / 200 = 5 shares instead of the actual 1 share.
Later, when the attacker liquidates this position, they can claim 5x more collateral than they should be able to based on the inflated debt share.

In essence, The key issue is around this [Line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L833-L835)
This calculates the new debt share to remove based on the amount repaid.

An attacker could exploit this by:

- Borrow a large amount of tokens to inflate the totalShare
- Repay only a small portion of their debt
- The lessShare deducted would be very small compared to their actual debt, since it is calculated based on the inflated totalShare
- When liquidating the position later, the attacker would get a bigger portion of collateral than they should based on their true remaining debt.

For example:
- Attacker borrows 100 tokens when totalShare is 1000
- This gives them a debtShare of 100
- Attacker repays only 1 token when totalShare is still 1000
lessShare is calculated as (1 * 1000) / totalDebt = 1
- So their debtShare is reduced by only 1, instead of ~100
- When liquidated, the attacker gets ~100x more collateral than they should have

## Impact
Attacker can manipulate the debt shares to receive an unfair amount of collateral when liquidating positions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
the _repay function should calculate the reduced debt share based only on the amount repaid and the initial debt share, not factoring in the total shares:
