# overflow in the _repay() function
## Summary
Allowing paid > amountCall without validation can introduce overflow risk in _repay
## Vulnerability Detail
The paid amount is the actual repaid amount returned from _doRepay(), which calls ICErc20.repayBorrow(). This paid amount is not validated to be <= amountCall before calculating lessShare.
So if paid is greater than amountCall due to an exploit in _doRepay(), the share calculation can overflow and reduce the share by a very large unexpected amount.
For example:
• amountCall = 100 tokens
• paid = 2^256 - 1 tokens (due to an overflow exploit)
• totalShare = 1000
• totalDebt = 10000

Then:
lessShare = (2^256 - 1 * 1000) / 10000 = 2^256 - 1
Reducing the share by 2^256 - 1 when only 100 tokens were expected to be repaid.
This could allow the attacker to artificially close out a huge portion of their debt


## Impact
Reduce share more than expected

## Recommendation
Paid should be validated to be <= amountCall before the lessShare calculation.
