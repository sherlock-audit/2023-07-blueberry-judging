# Missing Explicit Reverts for Enhanced User Clarity"
## Summary
The codebase utilizes "revert" statements without providing clear error messages, causing confusion for users and developers during transaction failures.

## Vulnerability Detail
- In the current codebase, the usage of "revert" statements is common for handling transaction failures. However, a vulnerability arises from the absence of explicit error messages accompanying these "revert" statements.
- This means that when a transaction fails, users and developers are not provided with specific information about the reason for the failure.
- This lack of clarity can lead to confusion and frustration, as users may not understand why their actions are being rejected, and developers may struggle to diagnose issues.
## Impact
Failure to include explicit error messages alongside "revert" statements can lead to user confusion, hinder development debugging, impede security assessments, and potentially expose the contract to vulnerabilities due to unclear transaction failure reasons.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Instead of using revert Errors.ZERO_ADDRESS();, provide an explicit error message to help developers and users understand why the transaction is reverting., like -
```solidity
if (address(config_) == address(0)) {
    emit Errors.ZERO_ADDRESS("Config address cannot be zero");
    revert("Config address cannot be zero");
}
config = config_;
```
