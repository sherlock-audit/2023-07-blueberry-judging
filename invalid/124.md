# Zero Address Validation implementation is incorrect.
## Summary
In function `getPrice`, `if(token == address(0))` then `token = token_` bypasses the zero address validation in the function. 
## Vulnerability Detail
In abstract contract `ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol`, the zero address validation check `if (token == address(0)) token = token_;`(line 105) is incorrect because if the token address is zero address, it will consider token = token_ which just bypasses the check. 

## Impact
`_token` address might be zero and caller won't recieve any price value from the chainlink oracle.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The mitigation steps are as follows:
```solidity
105     - if (token == address(0)) token = token_;
106     + if (token == address(0)) revert Errors.ZERO_ADDRESS();;

```
