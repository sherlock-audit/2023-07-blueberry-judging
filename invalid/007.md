# High Risk of being frontrun when removing liquidity in CurveSpell
## Summary
Inside the `_removeLiquidity` function in the CurveSpell contract, if the `isKilled` variable is true the contract will call the Curve `remove_liquidity` function, passing in `minOuts` as an array of uint256 with default values of `0`.

## Vulnerability Detail
This leaves the function vulnerable to being front-run by a MEV bot where the MEV bot can potentially steal all user funds by manipulating the curve pools as the expected `minOutAmount` is 0.

## Impact
Loss of all funds, that the LP is trying to withdraw.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Estimate the minOutAmount off-chain when removing all liquidity and pass it in as an argument.
