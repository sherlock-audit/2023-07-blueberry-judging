# Withdraw Fees Are Taken Twice When Withdrawing Lend
## Summary
The contract takes withdrawal fees twice during a single withdrawal operation. This results in users being charged double the intended fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
The duplication of withdrawal fees arises from two distinct functions within the smart contract. The first fee deduction occurs in the `withdraw` function present in the vault. Subsequently, a second fee is deducted in the `withdrawLend` function. This behavior is unintended and leads to an excessive fee being taken from the user's withdrawal amount.

## Impact
Users who perform withdrawals will be charged double the expected fee. This leads to potential financial losses for users, especially those who perform frequent withdrawals or withdraw large amounts.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to refactor the smart contract to ensure that the withdrawal fee is only deducted once. This can be achieved by removing the fee deduction from one of the two functions, preferably from the withdrawLend function to centralize fee deductions in the withdraw function.
