# Possible loss of funds due to reentrancy vulnerability while minting ERC-1155 tokens
## Summary
The `mint` function in the provided contract has a potential security concern due to the ordering of state changes and interactions with external contracts. This could allow malicious contracts to exploit a reentrancy vulnerability.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `mint` function of the contract is designed to facilitate the deposit of LP tokens into the farming pool while minting corresponding ERC-1155 tokens. However, a potential reentrancy vulnerability arises from the following sequence of actions:

- The user transfers LP tokens to the contract.
- The contract approves the `ichiFarm` contract to spend these LP tokens on behalf of the contract.
- The contract deposits the transferred LP tokens into the farming pool using the `ichiFarm.deposit` function.
- The contract mints ERC-1155 tokens representing the deposited LP tokens.
The issue lies in the ordering of interactions. If the `ichiFarm` contract, during its `deposit` function call, interacts with untrusted external contracts that perform arbitrary actions including reentrancy, it can trigger a reentrancy attack. In such an attack, the malicious contract can repeatedly call back into the `mint` function before it completes, potentially leading to unauthorized token transfers or manipulations.
## Impact
A successful reentrancy attack could allow malicious actors to drain the contract's funds, steal users' deposited tokens, and manipulate the contract's state, leading to financial losses and disruption of intended contract functionality.
