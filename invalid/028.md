# Inaccurate Token Price  (`token0` and `token1`) Calculation Due to Decimals Mismatch in `getPrice` Function
## Summary
The `getPrice` function in the `IchiVaultOracle` contract can produce highly incorrect price calculations when dealing with tokens that have a decimal precision other than 18. This issue arises due to assumptions about token decimals and can lead to unreliable price data.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the use of token decimals in the calculation of `totalReserve` within the `getPrice` function:
```solidity
uint256 totalReserve = (r0 * px0) / 10 ** t0Decimal +
                       (r1 * px1) / 10 ** t1Decimal;
```
This calculation assumes that both tokens (`token0` and `token1`) have 18 decimal places. If one or both tokens have a different number of decimal places, the resulting price calculations will be incorrect, leading to unreliable price feeds.
## Impact
Users receiving inaccurate price information for Ichi Vault tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You should scale the token amounts and prices using appropriate scaling factors to ensure consistent calculations.
```solidity
uint256 totalReserve = (r0 * px0 * 10 ** t1Decimal) / 10 ** t0Decimal +
                       (r1 * px1 * 10 ** t0Decimal) / 10 ** t1Decimal;
```
