# Owner can pause repayments or borrowing by updating the bankStatus bit flags, which could lock user funds
## Summary
The owner of BlueBerryBank can pause repayments or borrowing by updating the bankStatus variable, which could potentially lock user funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The bankStatus variable is a bitmask that controls the allowed actions on the protocol. The last 4 bits represent:
• Bit 0: Borrow allowed
• Bit 1: Repay allowed
• Bit 2: Lend allowed
• Bit 3: Withdraw lending allowed

The owner can call setBankStatus(uint256 _bankStatus) to update this bitmask. For example, to pause repayments, the owner could do: setBankStatus(bankStatus & ~0x2)
This would set the 2nd bit to 0, disallowing repayments.

Similarly, to pause borrowing, the owner could: setBankStatus(bankStatus & ~0x1)
This would set the 1st bit to 0.

When repayments are paused, the repay() and liquidate() functions will revert since they check:
if (!isRepayAllowed()) {
  revert Errors.REPAY_NOT_ALLOWED(); 
}
This prevents users from repaying their loans or getting liquidated. Their borrowed tokens remain locked in the protocol.

## Impact
The owner can pause critical actions like repay/borrow by updating bankStatus, locking user funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
• Making bankStatus a constant instead of variable
• Implementing a timelock/multisig on setBankStatus()
• Allowing repayments but disallowing borrowing
• Allowing only incremental status changes, not completely locking actions
