# pendingRewards() function can return incorrect reward
## Summary
The pendingRewards() relies on stored rewardPerShare values which can get stale. It does not check the latest values before calculating rewards. This could result in incorrect reward amounts being shown to users.
## Vulnerability Detail
It uses the stored accExtPerShare mapping to get rewardPerShare for extra rewards: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WAuraPools.sol#L291)
If this stored value is stale, the reward amount calculated will be wrong: [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WAuraPools.sol#L296-L302)
There is no check of the current rewardPerShare before calculating rewards
## Impact
Users can be shown incorrect pending rewards, either too high or too low
