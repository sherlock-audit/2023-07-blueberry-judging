# Reentrancy vulnerability in the withdraw() function
## Summary
The contract inherits from ReentrancyGuard, which helps prevent reentrancy attacks on the main functions. However, _ensureApprove() is called after redeeming tokens from bToken, which could be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. An attacker can initiate a recursive call back into withdraw() before the tokens are transferred out, draining more tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
The nonReentrant modifier prevents reentrancy on withdraw() itself, but _ensureApprove() could be called recursively before the tokens are transferred out.

An attacker could:
Call withdraw() with a large shareAmount
bToken.redeem() succeeds and transfers tokens to the vault
Before the tokens are sent out, _ensureApprove() is called
The attacker calls withdraw() again recursively
More tokens are redeemed from bToken before the previous tokens are sent out
Repeat to drain tokens
## Impact
An attacker can drain a lot more tokens than intended from a single call to withdraw().
