# Assumption of Fixed Decimals for ERC-20 Tokens
## Summary
The `getPrice` function assumes that all ERC-20 tokens, including those representing Stable Balancer LP tokens, have 18 decimals of precision. This assumption might lead to incorrect valuation results for tokens with a different number of decimals, potentially causing users to receive inaccurate USD valuations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function assumes that all ERC-20 tokens adhere to the standard 18 decimals of precision. 
```solidity
// Example of assuming 18 decimals
return minPrice.mulWadDown(pool.getRate());
```
## Impact
Tokens with decimals different from 18 might lead to valuation errors when interacting with the `getPrice` function. Users relying on this function to fetch the USD value of Stable Balancer LP tokens with a different number of decimals could receive misleading valuations. The consequences could include financial losses, incorrect investment decisions, or erroneous trading strategies.

## Recommendation
Consider updating the `getPrice` function to return the price in terms of token units, and not whole tokens.
