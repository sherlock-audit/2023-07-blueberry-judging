# Lack of Functionality to Pause Position Reduction in Protocol
## Summary
This is an issue from previous contest which hasn't been fixed.
[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/204)
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol lacks a specific mechanism to pause the functionality of reducing a position, which could expose the protocol to unintended liquidations, losses, or other negative outcomes.
## Impact
The absence of a mechanism to pause position reduction could have severe consequences for the protocol and its users. During situations when the protocol needs to be paused for various reasons (e.g., market volatility, discovered vulnerabilities, regulatory requirements), users should not be able to reduce their positions, as this action could further destabilize the protocol or exacerbate risks.
