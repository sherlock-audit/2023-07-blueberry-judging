# fee calculation during withdraw can be manipulated by the user
## Summary
The withdraw() function burns the user's ERC1155 tokens and withdraws the underlying ERC20 tokens. It calculates the withdrawal fee based on the shareAmount passed in by the user. A malicious user could pass in a fake inflated shareAmount to reduce their withdrawal fee.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that the shareAmount passed by the user is used to:
1. Burn the user's ERC1155 tokens
2. Approve the FeeManager contract to take the fee
3. Calculate the withdrawal fee in FeeManager
This means a malicious user could pass a very large shareAmount to burn more ERC1155 tokens than they actually have, get fee approved on that inflated amount, and reduce their withdrawal fee.
For example, a user has 100 ERC1155 tokens representing 100 DAI. The fee is 10%.
Normally:
• User burns 100 tokens
• FeeManager takes 10 DAI fee (10% of 100)
• User gets 90 DAI
Exploit:
• User burns 200 tokens (while only having 100)
• FeeManager approved to take 20 DAI fee (10% of 200)
• FeeManager only able to take 10 DAI due to user's balance
• User gets 90 DAI
This allows the user to reduce their fee payment

## Impact
User can manipulate share amount to pay less fees on withdraw

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
The contract should first burn the user's tokens based on the actual balance, and then calculate the fee based on the amount burned
