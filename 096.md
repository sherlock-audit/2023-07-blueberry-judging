# Mainnet oracles are incompatible with wstETH causing many popular yields strategies to be broken
## Summary

Mainnet oracles are incompatible with wstETH causing many popular yields strategies to be broken. Chainlink and Band do not have wstETH oracles and using Uniswap LP pairs would be very dangerous given their low liquidity. 

## Vulnerability Detail

[ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol#L111-L125](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol#L111-L125)

        uint256 decimals = registry.decimals(token, USD);
        (
            uint80 roundID,
            int256 answer,
            ,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = registry.latestRoundData(token, USD);
        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
            revert Errors.PRICE_OUTDATED(token_);
        if (answer <= 0) revert Errors.PRICE_NEGATIVE(token_);
        if (answeredInRound < roundID) revert Errors.PRICE_OUTDATED(token_);

        return
            (answer.toUint256() * Constants.PRICE_PRECISION) / 10 ** decimals;

ChainlinkAdapterOracle only supports single asset price data. This makes it completely incompatible with wstETH because chainlink doesn't have a wstETH oracle on mainnet. Additionally Band protocol doesn't offer a wstETH oracle either. This only leaves Uniswap oracles which are highly dangerous given their low liquidity.

## Recommendation

Create a special bypass specifically for wstETH utilizing the stETH oracle and it's current exchange rate.
