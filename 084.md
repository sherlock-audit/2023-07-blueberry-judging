# rounding error in the _repay() function that could lead to loss of shares over time
## Summary
The math for calculating share reduction can be susceptible to rounding errors, where the reduced share is a bit less than expected. Over many repayments, this could accumulate loss
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is with the division to calculate lessShare.
For example:
• paid = 100
• totalShare = 1000
• totalDebt = 10000
Then lessShare should be:
100 * 1000 / 10000 = 10
But due to rounding, it may calculate as 9 instead.
Over many repays, this minor rounding error could accumulate, resulting in the stored debtShare being slightly less than the true value.




## Impact
This can lead to loss of interest revenue for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
• Use more precision in the division, e.g. computeShare(paid, totalShare, totalDebt)
• Round up the result: lessShare = (paid * totalShare / totalDebt) + 1
• Occasionally reset shares to the true values.
