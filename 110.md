# rounding errors due to performing divisions on raw token amounts in _getPendingReward().
## Summary
_getPendingReward() function can introduce small rounding errors due to performing divisions on raw token amounts
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that share and amount are raw token amounts, but the division happens after multiplying them together. For example:
• share = 10000000000 (10 tokens)
• amount = 100000000000 (100 tokens)
• lpDecimals = 18
Multiplying first:
• share * amount = 10000000000000010000000000
Then dividing by 10^18:
• 10000000000000010000000000 / 1000000000000000000 = 10000010
The result should be 10 tokens but due to the multiplication first, we end up with a small rounding error.
This can lead to small discrepancies in the pending rewards calculations. Over time as more dividends are accrued, the errors could compound.


## Impact
Users gets slightly more or less rewards than expected. Inaccuracies in pending reward calculations could potentially be exploited by users to get more rewards than they should.

## Recommendation
convert share and amount to decimals before multiplying
