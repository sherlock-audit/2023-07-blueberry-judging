# Flash Loan Attack Risk in getPrice Function leads to financial losses
## Summary
The getPrice function in the provided code is vulnerable to a flash loan attack. This attack could allow an attacker to manipulate the total supply of a Uniswap pool and, consequently, manipulate the calculated price returned by the function. This can lead to financial losses for users who rely on the accuracy of the price for trading decisions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the getPrice function calculates the price based on the total supply of the pool, which is susceptible to manipulation using a flash loan attack. By artificially inflating the total supply of the pool, an attacker can skew the calculated price to their advantage, allowing them to trade at an artificially lower price and gain profits.

## Impact
If exploited, this vulnerability could result in significant financial losses for users who trade based on the manipulated price. The attacker could take advantage of the price discrepancy to execute trades that are not reflective of the actual market conditions, leading to unjust profits at the expense of other users.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/UniswapV2Oracle.sol#L57

     function getPrice(address pair) external override returns (uint256) {
        IUniswapV2Pair pool = IUniswapV2Pair(pair);
        uint256 totalSupply = pool.totalSupply();
        ..
        (uint256 r0, uint256 r1, ) = pool.getReserves();
        uint256 px0 = base.getPrice(token0);
        uint256 px1 = base.getPrice(token1); 
       ..    
        return (2 * sqrtK * BBMath.sqrt(px0 * px1)) / totalSupply;
    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
  Utilize a reputable price oracle service to fetch accurate and tamper-resistant price data. This can prevent attackers from manipulating the price by introducing external, reliable price feeds.
