# total supply per tokenId is not tracked
## Summary
The HardVault contract does not track total supply per tokenId
## Vulnerability Detail
The key issues are:
• _mint and _burn only update the caller's balance, not the total supply.
• balanceOfERC20 returns the caller's balance for a tokenId, not the total supply.
This means total shares per underlying token are not updated properly on deposit and withdrawal.

For example:
• Alice deposits 100 DAI, receives 100 DAI-shares
• Bob deposits 50 DAI, receives 50 DAI-shares
• Total DAI-shares should be 150, but contract has no way to know this
• Alice withdraws her 100 DAI-shares and receives 100 DAI
• Now only 50 DAI should remain, but contract still thinks 150 shares exist
• Bob could withdraw his 50 shares and drain the remaining DAI

## Impact
Inaccurate total shares, accounting errors, potential loss of assets and difficulty valuing shares
