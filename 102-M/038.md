# Possible price flactuation due to insufficient slippage protection in `ShortLongSpell.sol` contract
## Summary
The `_deposit` function within the `ShortLongSpell` contract interacts directly with the ParaSwap exchange to perform token swaps without implementing any form of slippage protection. This exposes users to potential losses due to price volatility during token swaps.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_deposit` function is designed to deposit isolated underlying collateral into the Blueberry Money Market, borrow tokens from it, swap the borrowed tokens using ParaSwap, and then deposit the swapped tokens into a SoftVault. However, the function directly performs token swaps with the ParaSwap exchange without incorporating safeguards against slippage.
```solidity
function _deposit(OpenPosParam calldata param, bytes calldata swapData) internal {
    // ...

    // Swap borrowed token to strategy token
    IERC20Upgradeable swapToken = ISoftVault(strategy.vault).uToken();
    uint256 dstTokenAmt = swapToken.balanceOf(address(this));

    address borrowToken = param.borrowToken;
    if (
        !PSwapLib.swap(
            augustusSwapper,
            tokenTransferProxy,
            borrowToken,
            param.borrowAmount,
            swapData
        )
    ) revert Errors.SWAP_FAILED(borrowToken);

    dstTokenAmt = swapToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - dstTokenAmt;
    if (dstTokenAmt == 0) revert Errors.SWAP_FAILED(borrowToken);

    // Deposit to SoftVault directly
    _ensureApprove(address(swapToken), address(strategy.vault), dstTokenAmt);
    ISoftVault(strategy.vault).deposit(dstTokenAmt);

    // ...
}
```

## Impact
The lack of slippage protection during token swaps exposes users to risks associated with price fluctuations. If the price of the tokens being swapped changes significantly between the time the swap is initiated and the time it's executed on the exchange, users could experience losses due to unexpected price disparities.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Require minimum and maximum values that the protocol is willing to accept for a slippage tolerance that will not cause significant fund loss during swaps.
