# No Slippage Protection while closing a position from Balancer pool and exiting the Aura farming
## Summary

Slippage parameter is not set and kept at default value of `0` allowing maximum slippage and loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `closePositionFarm` function of `AuraSpell.sol`, there is a call to exit pool and remove liquidity.

```solidity
File: AuraSpell.sol

    /// 3. Parameters for removing liquidity
    (
@->     uint256[] memory minAmountsOut,
        address[] memory tokens,
        uint256 borrowTokenIndex
    ) = _getExitPoolParams(param.borrowToken, lpToken);

    wAuraPools.getVault(lpToken).exitPool(
        IBalancerPool(lpToken).getPoolId(),
        address(this),
        address(this),
        IBalancerVault.ExitPoolRequest(
            tokens,
@->         minAmountsOut, // @audit-issue minAmountsOut = 0 here
            abi.encode(0, amountPosRemove, borrowTokenIndex),
            false
        )
    );


```

Here, focus on `minAmountsOut` parameter in `ExitPoolRequest` call on `BalancerVault`. As per the Balancer docs [here](https://docs.balancer.fi/reference/joins-and-exits/pool-exits.html#minamountsout),

> In the exitPool call, you have to provide minAmountsOut, the lower limits for the tokens to receive. In short, what are the minimum amounts you would find acceptable, given the amount of BPT you are providing?

> A good practice would be to user queryExit in BalancerQueries to find the current amounts of tokens you would get for your BPT, and then account for some possible slippage.

> Let's say that you want to allow a 1% slippage. After computing how many tokens you expect for a given amount of BPT, you'd apply a factor of 0.99 to all the amounts. These thresholds are important because it's possible for token amounts to change in the pool between the time you send your transaction and the when your transaction executes.

`minAmountsOut` is the slippage control parameter which needs to be a valid value. But it is derived from `_getExitPoolParams` function which just creates an empty array with default value `0` and pass it.

```solidity
File: AuraSpell.sol

  function _getExitPoolParams(
        address borrowToken,
        address lpToken
    ) internal view returns (uint256[] memory, address[] memory, uint256) {
        (address[] memory tokens, , ) = wAuraPools.getPoolTokens(lpToken);

        uint256 length = tokens.length;
@->     uint256[] memory minAmountsOut = new uint256[](length);
        uint256 exitTokenIndex;

        for (uint256 i; i != length; ) {
            if (tokens[i] == borrowToken) break;

            if (tokens[i] != lpToken) ++exitTokenIndex;

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

@->     return (minAmountsOut, tokens, exitTokenIndex); // @audit-info minAmountsOut value is zero here as it is not initialized anywhere
    }

```

This exposes user to maximum slippage while closing the position.

## Recommendation

As Balancer [docs](https://docs.balancer.fi/reference/contracts/query-functions.html#querybatchswap) suggest:

> A good practice would be to user queryExit in BalancerQueries to find the current amounts of tokens you would get for your BPT, and then account for some possible slippage.

Make a call to `queryExit` and then account for some possible slippage.

```solidity

  queryExit(
    bytes32 poolId,
    address sender,
    address recipient,
    ExitPoolRequest request)
  returns (uint256 bptIn, uint256[] amountsOut)


```
