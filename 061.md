# In CurveSpell.closePositionFarm, _removeLiquidity lacks slippage protection if isKilled is True
## Summary

When [[closePositionFarm](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/CurveSpell.sol#L168-L174)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/CurveSpell.sol#L168-L174) is called, `isKilled` will affect the execution logic of [[_removeLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/CurveSpell.sol#L257-L264)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/CurveSpell.sol#L257-L264). **If `isKilled` is set to false**, liquidity will be removed via [[ICurvePool(pool).remove_liquidity_one_coin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/CurveSpell.sol#L291-L294)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/CurveSpell.sol#L291-L294), whose second parameter is `param.amountOutMin` [[passed from the caller](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/CurveSpell.sol#L169)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/CurveSpell.sol#L169), so this is no problem. **If `isKilled` is set to true**, the liquidity will be removed via [[ICurvePool(pool).remove_liquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/CurveSpell.sol#L280)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/CurveSpell.sol#L280), whose second parameter is [[an empty array](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/CurveSpell.sol#L279)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/CurveSpell.sol#L279) representing the minOut of each token received. In Solidity, uninitialized values are all 0, so this way is vulnerable to sandwich attacks due to the lack of slippage protection.

## Vulnerability Detail

`closePositionFarm` internally calls `_removeLiquidity` to remove liquidity. Only cases where `isKilled` is set to true are discussed here.

```solidity
File: blueberry-core\contracts\spell\CurveSpell.sol
258:     function _removeLiquidity(
259:         ClosePosParam memory param,
260:         bool isKilled,
261:         address pool,
262:         address[] memory tokens,
263:         IBank.Position memory pos,
264:         uint256 amountPosRemove
265:     ) internal {
......
277:         if (isKilled) {
278:             uint256 len = tokens.length;
279:             if (len == 2) {
280:->               uint256[2] memory minOuts;
281:                 ICurvePool(pool).remove_liquidity(amountPosRemove, minOuts);
282:             } else if (len == 3) {
283:->               uint256[3] memory minOuts;
284:                 ICurvePool(pool).remove_liquidity(amountPosRemove, minOuts);
285:             } else if (len == 4) {
286:->               uint256[4] memory minOuts;
287:                 ICurvePool(pool).remove_liquidity(amountPosRemove, minOuts);
288:             } else {
289:                 revert("Invalid pool length");
290:             }
291:         } else {
......
298:     }
```

We can see that the `minOuts` array of L280/L283/L286 are all empty arrays, where each item is 0. `minOuts` represents the minimum amounts of underlying coins to receive, which is specified by the caller. [[This is slippage protection](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/master/contracts/pools/aeth/StableSwapAETH.vy#L498)](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/master/contracts/pools/aeth/StableSwapAETH.vy#L498). If `minOuts` are all 0, then the underlying coins allowed to be received are arbitrary values. If this is noticed by a malicious user, the caller will suffer from a sandwich attack.

## Impact

When calling `closePositionFarm`, if `isKilled` is set to true, the caller is vulnerable to a sandwich attack and loses funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If `minOuts` cannot be calculated off-chain, it is recommended to delete the relevant code when `isKilled` is true and only use `remove_liquidity_one_coin`.

Here is an unproved idea for `minOuts`:

Suppose pool has two tokens, the liquidity to be removed is 10e18 which will be divided into two parts, and `maxPer` is the slippage protection 95%. We can calculate the `minOuts` array off-chain:

```fix
minOuts[0] = pool.calc_withdraw_one_coin(5e18, 0) * maxPer
minOuts[1] = pool.calc_withdraw_one_coin(5e18, 1) * maxPer
```

`minOuts` can be passed as an parameter to `closePositionFarm`. This is better than an empty array.
