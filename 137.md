# MAX_TIME_GAP can be set too high for token price feeds whose heartbeat is as low as 1 hour.
## Summary
The ``MAX_TIME_GAP`` set to check the freshness of the token price feeds can be set as much as ``2 days`` whilst some pair of tokens have freshness intervals as low as ``1 hour`` for ethereum chain and even lower than ``1 hour`` for  other chains.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ``MAX_TIME_GAP`` for freshness check is ``2 days`` meaning no token price feeds can exceed this limit. But, Let's say for ``Chainlink Price Feeds``, no pair has heartbeat more than ``1 days``. Hence, ``MAX_TIME_GAP`` needs to be configured differently as per the oracle used or token pair used.

The ``MAX_TIME_GAP`` is checked and set here:

## Impact
The time gap or freshness threshold if checked or configured inaccurately can cause the freshness validation to be useless for some pairs which can return stale data.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Configure  ``MAX_TIME_GAP`` as per the oracle used or token pair used.

For example:

The [LINK/USD](https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet/crypto-usd/link-usd) has a heartbeat of ``3600 seconds``, so  ``MAX_TIME_GAP`` should be set accordingly. Similarly, For oracles, Let's say ``Chainlink``, the max heartbeat for any pair of tokens is ``86400 seconds``  and that also should be configured accordingly.
