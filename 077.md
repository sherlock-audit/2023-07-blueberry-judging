# AuraSpell#_getJoinPoolParamsAndApprove Leads to maxAmountsIn[i] Mismatch with Existing LP Tokens
## Summary
The `maxAmountsIn[i]` mismatch occurs when an LP token exists. This mismatch arises due to a discrepancy in the increase logic between `amountsIn` and `maxAmountsIn` arrays. This vulnerability is present in the `AuraSpell#_getJoinPoolParamsAndApprove` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `AuraSpell#_getJoinPoolParamsAndApprove` function:

```solidity
for (i; i != length; ) {
    if (tokens[i] != lpToken) {
        amountsIn[j] = IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (amountsIn[j] > 0) {
            _ensureApprove(tokens[i], vault, amountsIn[j]);
        }
        ++j;
    } else isLPIncluded = true;

    maxAmountsIn[i] = IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this));

    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}

if (isLPIncluded) {
    assembly {
        mstore(amountsIn, sub(mload(amountsIn), 1))
    }
}
```

When `tokens[i]` is equal to `lpToken`, `isLPIncluded` is set to true, and the `++j` increment is skipped. This issue causes a discrepancy between `amountsIn` and `maxAmountsIn` if the LP token is not positioned at the last index.

## Impact

If `isLPIncluded` is involved in the `openPositionFarm` process of adding liquidity, it may lead to a revert and potentially result in a denial-of-service attack on the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue:

Ensure that the `amountsIn` and `maxAmountsIn` arrays have the same length and that their data matches. This can be done by making sure that the incrementing logic for both arrays is consistent, even when an LP token is encountered. This will prevent the mismatch between the two arrays and potential vulnerabilities.
