# Precision Loss in Calculation of lessShare Variable
## Summary
The code snippet provided contains a potential vulnerability related to precision loss during the calculation of the lessShare variable. This vulnerability arises from the order of operations in the calculation, which involves multiplication and division operations. As a result, there is a risk of losing decimal precision in the calculated value, leading to inaccurate results in certain scenarios.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the code snippet, the lessShare variable is calculated as follows:

    uint256 lessShare = paid == oldDebt  ? oldShare   : (paid * totalShare) / totalDebt;
 
 This  can potentially cause precision loss when paid * totalShare is lower and almost equal to totalDebt.
And as such 0 would be subsracted from bank.totalShare and pos.debtShare.
## Impact
The precision loss in the calculation of lessShare can lead to inaccurate results, particularly when dealing with large values. This imprecision could have negative effects on the system's accounting and bookkeeping, potentially affecting user balances and overall financial integrity.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L833

    function _repay(
        uint256 positionId,
        address token,
        uint256 amountCall
    ) internal returns (uint256, uint256) {
        ..
        if (paid > oldDebt) revert Errors.REPAY_EXCEEDS_DEBT(paid, oldDebt); /// prevent share overflow attack
        uint256 lessShare = paid == oldDebt
            ? oldShare
            : (paid * totalShare) / totalDebt;
        bank.totalShare -= lessShare;
        pos.debtShare -= lessShare;
        return (paid, lessShare);
    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Perform the necessary calculations using the decimal values to avoid precision loss. This calculation should now retain better precision compared to using regular integers.
