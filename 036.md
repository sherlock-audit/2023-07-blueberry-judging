# Gas Limit Exhaustion Risk in Reward Token Transfers
## Summary
The `burn` function's reward distribution mechanism involves transferring multiple reward tokens to the caller. Due to the potential gas consumption of these transfers, there is a risk of transactions running out of gas, which can prevent users from receiving their rewards.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `burn` function aims to transfer harvested rewards to the caller by using a loop to execute individual `safeTransfer` calls for each reward token. However, if the `rewardTokens` array contains a large number of reward tokens or the reward amounts (`rewards` array) are substantial, the cumulative gas cost of executing multiple transfers can exceed the gas limit set for a transaction.
```solidity
// Transfer the harvested rewards to the user
uint rewardLen = rewardTokens.length;
for (uint i; i < rewardLen; i++) {
    IERC20Upgradeable(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(msg.sender, rewards[i]);
}
```
## Impact
In situations where the gas required for reward token transfers exceeds the gas limit of a transaction, users may experience transaction failures due to out-of-gas errors. This can prevent users from receiving their rewards in a single transaction, leading to frustration and inconvenience for users.

## Recommendation
Implement a batch transfer mechanism that consolidates multiple token transfers into a single function call.
