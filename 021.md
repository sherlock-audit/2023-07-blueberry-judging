# `mint` function in `WConvexPools.sol` and `WAuraPools.sol` can fail silently
## Summary
`mint` function is used deposit some LP amount and mint some ERC1155 corresponding to that amount, but the `deposit` function inside the `mint` can fail silently which will make the funds transferred in the contract be stuck.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `mint` first transfers the LP tokens to the contract

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WConvexPools.sol#L242-L246
and then tries to call `deposit` on those specific pools

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WAuraPools.sol#L328
but those functions will return a boolean if the deposit is successful or not as can be seen here

https://etherscan.io/address/0xA57b8d98dAE62B26Ec3bcC4a365338157060B234#code#F1#L462
boolean value that is never handled, which can cause the functions to revert silently since it does multiple external calls, but since it doesn't revert the contract assumes that everything worked correctly and will continue and `mint` the ERC1155 tokens 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WAuraPools.sol#L334
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WConvexPools.sol#L253
The LP tokens will be stuck in the contract since withdrawing will not be possible because no new LP tokens are minted by Convex or Aura protocols.
## Impact
Impact is a high one since it can lead to loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the return value and revert if the return value is not true so the whole transaction will not pass.
