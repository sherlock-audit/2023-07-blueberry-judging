# Unhandled Fee-on-Transfer Case in the Lend Method
## Summary
The `BlueBerryBank` contract exhibits inconsistent behavior in handling fee-on-transfer tokens. While the contract correctly accounts for the transferred amount in multiple instances by calculating the difference between the balance before and after a transaction, it fails to do so in the `lend` function. This oversight can lead to discrepancies in the amount of tokens a lender believes they are depositing versus the actual amount credited to their account.

## Vulnerability Detail
In many functions within the contract, the actual transferred amount is determined by computing the difference between the token balance before and after the transaction. This method effectively handles tokens that deduct a fee on transfer. However, in the `lend` function, where a lender deposits their underlying token into the contract, this mechanism is absent. As a result, if the underlying token deducts a fee on transfer, the lend function will not account for this fee, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual deposited amounts.

## Impact
Mismatch between the expected and actual deposited amounts when a lender is depositing tokens in the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is crucial to modify the lend function to consistently handle fee-on-transfer tokens. The function should be refactored to calculate the actual transferred amount by determining the difference between the token balance before and after the deposit transaction.
