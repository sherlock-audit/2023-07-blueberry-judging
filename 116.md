# CurveVolatileOracle.sol reports heavily overvalued price of curve LP tokens for volatile pools
## Summary
CurveVolatileOracle assumes wrong decimals for prices leading to incorrect calculation of LP price for curve volatile pools.

## Vulnerability Detail
[``getPrice``](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/7c7e1c4a8f3012d1afd2e598b656010bb9127836/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/CurveVolatileOracle.sol#L100-L127) calculates the price of a given Curve lp token using prices sourced from the base oracle ([Chainlink price feeds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol) processed through CoreOracle or AggregatorOracle contracts, returned in terms of USD with 18 decimals). However, it incorrectly assumes that the prices are in Chainlink’s decimals (8). Consequently, every price is scaled up by 10 decimals (1e18/1e8) leading to ``product`` having a minimum of 38 decimals (max 48 decimals if number of tokens in the pool is 3) instead of 18 decimals. ``answer`` is then computed using the ``product`` with Balancer’s ``FixedPoint`` math library. The issue is ``FixedPoint`` functions assume the values passed in have 18 decimals, so the ``answer`` returned is heavily inflated. (Note it is also incorrectly scaled down at the end by 10 decimals, it seems it is being calculated with the intent of scaling to 8 decimals, though ``answer`` is still inflated by at least 10 decimals)

Since the price is queried without comparison to other sources (as seen on the [project's readme](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/tree/main/blueberry-core#oracle), LP tokens for Curve volatile pools will be severely overvalued within the protocol.

This is significant in the [validation of position sizes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/7c7e1c4a8f3012d1afd2e598b656010bb9127836/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/BasicSpell.sol#L273-L300) for Curve integrated strategies (such as in ConvexSpell and (out of scope) CurveSpell) involving volatile pools. Since the added position size is calculated by multiplying the price obtained from the corresponding oracle of the lp token with the Spell contract’s balance of the lp token, the added position size will be significantly overestimated (as [``maxPositionSize``](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/7c7e1c4a8f3012d1afd2e598b656010bb9127836/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/BasicSpell.sol#L39-L47) is denominated in USD). Consequently, attempts to open positions with valid collateral amounts may revert unexpectedly, obstructing interactions with Curve strategies.

## Impact
Unexpected reverts on attempts to open valid positions with strategies involving lp tokens for Curve volatile pools due to heavily inflated price reporting by CurveVolatileOracle, decreasing potential protocol gain and user ability to borrow within a strategy's bounds.

## Recommendation
Consider directly multiplying (and scale down to 18 decimals each time) the prices obtained in ``getPrice`` and do not scale the returned ``answer`` down to 8 decimals.
