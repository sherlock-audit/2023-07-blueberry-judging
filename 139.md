# Risk of Insolvency Due to Blocked `Repayment`
## Summary
The protocol's have a vulnerability where a blocked `repay` function could lead to an accumulation of bad debt during extreme market events, potentially resulting in the protocol's insolvency.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the protocol's dependency on the `repayment enable` to liquidated users. If this function is `blocked`, it disrupts the protocol's ability to liquidate users cause user can't be liquidated if the `repay` is block. This situation prevents the protocol from liquidating underwater positions, leading to an accumulation of bad debt.

### Lets look at the POC below:
### Initial State:
The protocol's `repay` function is `blocked`.

### Market Crash:
A significant market crash occurs, causing a sharp decline in the prices of tokens used as collateral for the protocol's positions

### Blocked Repay Function:
As the `repay` function is `blocked`, users can't be liquidated which will cause `badDebt` for the protocol

### Liquidation Ineffectiveness:
The `liquidate` function, which depends on the `repay` function, becomes ineffective because repayments cannot occur.

### Undercollateralization:
The protocol's positions become increasingly `undercollateralized` due to the market crash and the inability to liquidated the users

### Accumulation of Bad Debt:
As the protocol cannot liquidate underwater positions, bad debt accumulates rapidly, reducing the overall value of the protocol's assets.

### Insolvency and Failure:
In the event that the accumulated bad debt surpasses the protocol's reserves and available assets, the protocol becomes insolvent and is unable to cover its liabilities. This situation could ultimately lead to the protocol's failure.

## Impact
If the repay function is blocked, users cannot be liquidated, which has cascading effects:

1. In the event of a market crash, positions become `undercollateralized.`
2. The inability to liquidate positions prevents bad debt from being recovered.
3. Accumulation of bad debt risks the protocol's solvency and can lead to insolvency.
4. The protocol's value and reputation could be compromised, potentially leading to failure.
