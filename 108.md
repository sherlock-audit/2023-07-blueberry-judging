# WAuraPools doesn't correctly account for AuraStash causing all deposits to be permanently lost
## Summary

Some Aura pools have two sources of AURA. First from the booster but also as a secondary reward. This secondary reward is stash AURA that doesn't behave like regular AURA. Although properly accounted for in AuraSpell, it is not properly accounted for in WAuraPools, resulting in all deposits being unrecoverable. 

## Vulnerability Detail

[WAuraPools.sol#L413-L418](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WAuraPools.sol#L413-L418)

        uint256 rewardTokensLength = rewardTokens.length;
        for (uint256 i; i != rewardTokensLength; ) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(
                msg.sender,
                rewards[i]
            );

When burning the wrapped LP token, it attempts to transfer each token to msg.sender. The problem is that stash AURA cannot be transferred like an regular ERC20 token and any transfers will revert. Since this will be called on every attempted withdraw, all deposits will be permanently unrecoverable.

## Impact

All deposits will be permanently unrecoverable

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if reward is stash AURA and send regular AURA instead similar to what is done in AuraSpell.
