# _getPendingReward() function is vulnerable to manipulation of the rewardPerToken
## Summary
_getPendingReward() function is vulnerable to manipulation of the rewardPerToken by a malicious reward contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
This assumes enRewardPerToken (the current reward per token from the rewarder contract) will always be >= stRewardPerShare (the stored reward per token).

A malicious rewarder contract could manipulate rewardPerToken() to decrease it below the stored value. This would make share a very large number. When multiplied by the user's balance, it could withdraw unexpectedly large rewards.
## Impact
If stRewardPerShare was 100 and the malicious contract returned 50 for rewardPerToken(), share would be 50. This could let the user steal 50x their balance in rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
Store the last enRewardPerToken and compare to make sure it increases each time
