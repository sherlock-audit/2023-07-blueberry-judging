# Flash loan attack in `getPrice` function of `uniswapV2Oracle.sol`
## Summary
The function `getPrice` is vulnerable to a `flash loan` attack. The attacker can borrow a large amount of money from a lending protocol, then use the money to make a trade on Uniswap that temporarily increases the price of one of the tokens in the pool. The attacker then uses the increased price to make a profit on the trade, and then returns the borrowed money to the lending protocol before the transaction expires.

## Vulnerability Detail
uniswapV2Oracle.getPrice is returning the USD based price of the given input but the vulnerability arise because the function is making an external call to uniswap getReserve function.

```solidity
        (uint256 r0, uint256 r1, ) = pool.getReserves(); 
```

according to `uniswap` getReserve `"Returns the reserves of token0 and token1 used to price trades and distribute liquidity."`

so if a malicious trade successfully execute flashLoan the he will be able to disrupt the total supply the he can change the reserves of  token1 and token2 and this function is checking for the `total supply` of provided pair in the `pool` and then using that total Supply it is making the calculation

```solidity
IUniswapV2Pair pool = IUniswapV2Pair(pair);
        uint256 totalSupply = pool.totalSupply();
```

so total supply can also be manipulated using FlashLoan

## Impact

Due to flashLoan and manipulating the price of tokens an attacker could make profit at the expense of other users and this could result in a loss of millions of dollars for the protocol and its users.
