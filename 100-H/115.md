# CurveTricryptoOracle.sol reports heavily undervalued price of tricrypto LP token allowing unsafe position sizes
## Summary
The getPrice function in CurveTricryptoOracle.sol calculates the price of the tricrypto LP token in ETH rather than USD resulting in extremely undervalued prices reported in the protocol’s context.

## Vulnerability Detail
The getPrice function of all oracles in the protocol is supposed to return prices in USD with 18 decimals of precision. This assumption is held when any other contract calls getPrice from an oracle (ie. when [validating the position size](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/7c7e1c4a8f3012d1afd2e598b656010bb9127836/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/BasicSpell.sol#L39-L47)) .

The ``CurveTricryptoOracle`` [getPrice function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/7c7e1c4a8f3012d1afd2e598b656010bb9127836/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/CurveTricryptoOracle.sol#L48-L65)  calculates the lp price of a Curve tricrypto lp token using the internal function [lpPrice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/7c7e1c4a8f3012d1afd2e598b656010bb9127836/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/CurveTricryptoOracle.sol#L73-L80) with prices for each of the three tokens in the pool obtained using ``base.getPrice()`` (which, from the test and deployment scripts, can be deduced to be obtained from Chainlink USD price feeds for each token processed by the protocol’s [Chainlink oracle contracts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol#L98-L127) and reported in USD with 18 decimals). The result of ``lpPrice`` is the price of the given tricrypto LP token in USD with 18 decimals (can be verified by manual calculation compared to Curve's pricing and comparison to similar equations used by [Yearn](https://etherscan.io/address/0xAba04e7fe37fc3808d601DE4d65690E2889d7621#code) and [Curve](https://github.com/curvefi/tricrypto-ng/blob/0bc1191b6097c8854e4f09e385f6c2c79a5bb773/contracts/main/CurveTricryptoOptimizedWETH.vy#L1698-L1713)). The issue is this price is then further divided by ``ethPrice`` (after scaling by 18 decimals) which is the price of ETH in USD, and then returns the result of this calculation. Consequently, the price reported is in ETH rather than USD, breaking the assumption held when interacting with the oracle.

As a result, since the price is interpreted as a USD price, the price of Curve tricrypto LP tokens will be extremely undervalued (considering the USD price of WETH is approx 1850 USD as of time of writing). Since LP prices are not determined through aggregated sources (as seen in the [project's readme](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/tree/main/blueberry-core#oracle)), CurveTricryptoOracle will be the source of truth for tricrypto LP tokens, which will be extremely undervalued in the protocol’s contracts.

This is significant when [validating the position size](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/7c7e1c4a8f3012d1afd2e598b656010bb9127836/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/BasicSpell.sol#L273-L300) to be within a strategy’s parameters that involves the tricrypto pool (which seems to be yet to be implemented from the comments). The added position size is calculated by multiplying the reported LP price with the LP balance of the Spell contract, so it will be severely underestimated allowing users to open and manage positions collectively far greater than permissible by the strategy’s parameters ([``maxPositionSize``](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-blueberry/blob/7c7e1c4a8f3012d1afd2e598b656010bb9127836/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/BasicSpell.sol#L39-L47) which is denominated in USD) -  (specifically, the last user can overstep the ``maxPositionSize`` since the calculation of the previous position size is not affected) . This is very dangerous as the protocol, and consequently its users, can be silently exposed to additional, unaccounted for risk. 
(otherwise, opening positions may revert for valid amounts due to undervalued positions falling beneath the ``minPositionSize``)

## Impact
Unexpected additional risk past permissible bounds set by strategies employing Curve tricrypto pools due to extremely undervalued reporting of LP token price and consequently dangerous position size leading to high potential loss of funds for users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider directly returning the ``lpPrice`` result (ie. without ``* 1e18 / ethPrice``).
Additionally, consider using Curve's LP price calculation formula (with div by 1e18 instead of 1e24) to get the price of the LP token in terms of the 0th token (ie. USDT) and multiplying this by the USD price of USDT (then scaling to 1e18) to get the LP price in USD. Manual testing with Chainlink prices comparing both expressions suggested the formula used here differs by up to 1 USD from Curve's LP price formula (after conversion to USD).
