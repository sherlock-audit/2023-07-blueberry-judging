# Lack of Withdraw Mechanism in CurveStableOracle.sol and Potential Funds Lockup
## Summary
The purpose of this report is to highlight a critical issue within the smart contract CurveStableOracle.sol. The contract contains a potential vulnerability that can lead to the permanent lockup of user funds. This vulnerability arises due to the absence of a withdraw mechanism, combined with the presence of an external payable fallback function (receive()). As a result, if users accidentally send Ether to this contract, the funds may become inaccessible, leading to a loss of assets

## Vulnerability Detail
The primary vulnerability in CurveStableOracle.sol is the absence of a proper withdrawal mechanism. The contract includes an external payable fallback function called receive(). This function enables the contract to accept incoming Ether without any specific logic for handling or returning the funds. Without a corresponding withdraw function, users who mistakenly send Ether to this contract will be unable to recover their funds.

## Impact
Users accidentally send Ether to this contract, the funds become inaccessible, leading to a loss of user ETH.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability and ensure the safety of user funds, the following actions are recommended:

Bacause this contract not suppouse to receive ETH you can just remove this function
Or
Implement a Withdraw Mechanism: Introduce a mechanism within the contract that allows users or owners to withdraw Ether that has been mistakenly sent to the contract. This could involve creating a dedicated function that transfers the Ether back to the sender.
