# Vulnerable Liquidation Process Exposes Liquidators to Losses Due to Collateral Manipulation
## Summary
The `liquidation` process is susceptible to manipulation, allowing borrowers to intentionally exploit the liquidation mechanism. By withdrawing all collateral and accruing debt through the `takeCollateral()` function, malicious borrowers can create a situation where their position becomes `liquidatable`, but the liquidator is left with no `collateral` to recover while still being obligated to repay the borrower's debt. This flaw results in potential financial losses for liquidators, jeopardizing the integrity of the protocol's liquidation process.

## Vulnerability Detail

Lets take the following example:

### Initialization:
A borrower initializes a position with a certain amount of collateral and takes on a debt using the contract's functions.

### Collateral Manipulation:
The borrower calls the `takeCollateral` function, withdrawing their entire collateral.

### Liquidation Attempt:
1): The borrower intentionally triggers conditions that render their position `liquidatable`.
2): A potential liquidator detects the liquidatable position and attempts to liquidate it by invoking the liquidate function.

### Exploitation:
1): Due to the borrower's manipulation, the liquidator calculates that the collateral size `(liqSize)` is `0`, as there is no collateral 
      remaining in the position.
2): The liquidator goes through with the liquidation process, repaying the borrower's debt to the contract.

### Outcome:
1): The liquidator successfully repays the debt but receives no collateral in return because the calculated liqSize is 0.
2): As a result, the liquidator loses the funds used to repay the debt without any offsetting collateral recovery.

## Impact
Malicious borrowers can exploit this vulnerability to cause liquidators to lose funds without receiving any collateral in return. This not only exposes liquidators to financial losses but also undermines the security and fairness of the liquidation mechanism, potentially discouraging participation in the protocol.

## Recommendation
Consider implementing safeguards that prevent liquidation when the borrower's collateral is insufficient to cover their debt,
