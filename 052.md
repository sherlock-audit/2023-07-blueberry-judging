# Lack of Withdrawal Mechanism for Earned Interest and Rewards
## Summary
The contract lacks a mechanism for users to withdraw interest and rewards earned from lending tokens to the `BlueBerryBank` contract. As a result, any interest or rewards accumulated within the contract are at risk of becoming permanently locked, leaving users unable to access their earnings.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerable contract contains two functions, lend and `withdrawLend`, that allow users to lend tokens as collateral and withdraw lent tokens, respectively. However, there is no provision in the contract for handling the interest or rewards earned from lending. This oversight prevents users from withdrawing the interest and rewards they've accrued, resulting in a potential loss of these earnings.\
```solidity
function withdrawLend(
    address token,
    uint256 shareAmount
) external override inExec poke(token) {
    if (!isWithdrawLendAllowed()) revert Errors.WITHDRAW_LEND_NOT_ALLOWED();
    Position storage pos = positions[POSITION_ID];
    Bank memory bank = banks[token];
    if (token != pos.underlyingToken) revert Errors.INVALID_UTOKEN(token);
    if (shareAmount == type(uint256).max) {
        shareAmount = pos.underlyingVaultShare;
    }

    // ... Withdrawal logic ...

    pos.underlyingVaultShare -= shareAmount;

    // ... Fee deduction and token transfer ...
}
```
## Impact
 Any interest or rewards that users have earned from lending their tokens to the bank will remain locked within the contract.

## Recommendation
Consider letting users receive the full amount of collateral and the interest earned from lending the collateral to borrowers.
